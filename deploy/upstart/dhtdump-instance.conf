# When stopping the service, we need to give the process some time to shut down
# before attempting to kill it. dhtdump doesn't have any special shutdown
# behaviour, so we just give it 5 seconds.

# Ignore any console output the process performs. (Without this stanza, there
# can be problems when shutting the instance down.)
console none

# Set resource limits
limit nofile 100000 100000

# Set a low oom score, preventing the processes from being killed

# Restart the process, if it stops unexpectedly

# Drop the permissions

# Run dhtdump in the instance folder. A symlink named `dhtdump` is expected
# to be present in each instance folder. This allows different binaries to be
# run, per instance (e.g. for test or release candidate deployments).
